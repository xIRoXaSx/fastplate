# Starting from here, we want to import multiple files located in this directory.
# The import statement can have a space between the '#' or not ("#import" / "# import").
ImportExample:
  # import ./testdata/src/partials/description.yaml

  # If enabled, indentation in front of an import statement will be applied to the whole imported section.
  # The content of the imported file will automatically have the prepended spaces / tabs.
  # This works with any amount of spaces / tabs.
  Indention:
    # import ./testdata/src/partials/indention.yaml

  # Nesting imports
  # ~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
  # Nested imports allow for more flexibility.
  # In this example, the correct YAML indention comes directly from inside the imported file(s).
  NestedImports: |
  # import ./testdata/src/partials/nested.yaml

  # Ignoring parts of a file
  # ~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
  # You can ignore lines via the ignore start / end syntax!
  # This is pretty handy if you don't want certain sections in the output file.
  # import ignore start
  #   These two lines will not show up in the output file.
  #   This also allows for template specific documentation.
  # import ignore end

  # Using variables
  # ~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~
  # By declaring scoped / local variables in the syntax down below, you can reuse values in the same template (file).
  # You can declare a var.gport file or use the optional "-var <file_path>" argument to define unscoped / global variables.
  # This allows you to use variables regardless of the template.
  # The following options are valid for both scopes: x = y, x= y, x =y, x=y.
  # Declaring a variable:
  #   # import var test = 1
  # Using the syntax:
  #   This is a text which includes {{test}} variable.
  # Example:
  #   A value like the threshold down below may be used in multiple places
  #   and can therefor be declared as an import var.
  Variables:
    # import var scoped_threshold = 0.75
    Threshold: {{scoped_threshold}}
    Message: The threshold of {{scoped_threshold}} has been reached.
    # import ./testdata/src/partials/varscopes.yaml
# End of file.
