    These lines should be ignored.

    # yatt ignore
      Nested ignore statements should always be ignored because of the first evaluated ignore preprocessor.
    # yatt ignoreend
    Since the first ignore statement is still in use, this line is also not output.
  # yatt ignoreend
  finished: This line should be visible at the end.
