If-statements: |
  If-statements can be used to write out text according to some value.
  This helps if you only want to use some text in specific circumstances.
  For instance, the result below should return "true": 
  # fastplate if {{add(actual, 1)}} == {{expected}}
  Result: true
  # fastplate else
  Result: false
  # fastplate ifend
